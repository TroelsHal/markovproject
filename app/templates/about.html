<p>This page creates random Beatles-lyrics, based on the albums that you have chosen.</p>

<h2>Markov chain</h2>
<p>The lyrics are created with a stochastic model, called a <a class="abouttext" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain">Markov chain</a>.</p>
<p>This is a sequence where the probability of the next event depends only on the state of the previous event.</p>
<p>The Markov chain is named after the Russian mathematician <a class="abouttext" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Markov">Andrey Markov</a>.</p>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>When you choose a number of Beatles albums, the program will collect the lyrics from these albums.</p>
<p>It will then go trough the lyrics and construct a dictionary of all the different words used on these albums - and for each word: a list of all the words that follow this word.</p>

<p>An example: The word "bird" appears seven times (if you choose all albums). Two times it is followed by "can", once by "is", three times by "will" and once by "and".</p>
<p>In the dictionary it will look like this:</p>
<p>{"bird": [["can", 2], ["is", 1], ["will", 3], ["and", 1]] ....}.</p>

<p>When the program makes a new song, it just needs to choose a random start word, and then it uses the dictionary to randomly select the next word.</p>

<p>So if the first word is "bird", the program knows that there is a 2/7 probability that the second word should be "can", 1/7 that it should be "is", and so on.</p>

<p>After the program has chosen the second word, it will then look this word up in the dictionary and see what the probabilities are for the third word...</p>

<h2>Making a song</h2>
<p>This sequence of chosing new random words could go on forever.</p>
<p>But the program knows a little about making a song. It knows that there should be a some verses and a chorus (that is repeated a few times).</p>

<p>It knows that the song should not be to long, so for example it's only allowed to add a third verse, if the verses turn out to be nice and short.</p>

<p>It also knows that the song should have a title â€“ and that this should probably be the first few words of the chorus or of the first verse.</p>
